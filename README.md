# VIKI


# INTRODUCTION

Welcome to my Github page for VIKI

# What is VIKI

VIKI is a personal assistant coded in Python. As I advance in my learning with Python I'll be improving VIKI when I can.

# What does VIKI do

At the moment, not much. currently I have VIKI running on my RaspberryPi 3 with access from outside the network using web sockets so I can communicate with it using my phone.

# Features

1. Use of the Wikipedia module allows me to gain the summary of any wiki pages.
2. Able to send requests to IFTTT.
3. Self-updates, I upload the new version to a web server and VIKI will check, download and install the new version with little downtime.

# Planned Features

1. Log all messages I receive on my phone to help towards a text prediction module.
2. Keep track of all phone stats (Battery, location, etc).
3. Monitor game servers and alert when they go down.
4. Monitor the weather. Also knowing my current location can help towards local weather alerts.
5. Monitor YouTube channels to notify of new videos.
6. More to follow.

# Current Modules In Use

1. AutoBahn
2. Wikipedia
3. Requests
4. Yaspy
5. Twisted

# FAQ

1. How do you communicate with VIKI?

I currently have VIKI hosted on my RaspberryPi 3, which I use the module Autobahn to accept web socket messages. Using Tasker on my phone I can send a message to VIKI to kick start certain fucntions.

2. Will you do voice commands?

I can do voice commands using Tasker and AutoVoice but it's not directly related to VIKI and the commands are not intuituve, such as "Wiki Summary Github"

3. Can I help out?

Sure! Whether it's using my code or giving advice. Contact me at Thomas@IronPhreak.com

4. How complex do you want to make it?

Tough question, as I'm fairly new to Python, I want to make it as good as I can so how complex that gets, I don't know. But I'm not one to say no to a challenge.
